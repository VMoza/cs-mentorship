          question: "How would you design a scalable URL shortening service?", 
          hint: "Consider how to handle billions of URLs and users.", 
          solution: "Use a key-value store with horizontal scaling and caching to handle billions of URLs. Partition the URL data across multiple servers, and use consistent hashing to map URLs to servers."

          question: "How would you handle collisions in short URLs?", 
          hint: "Consider hash collisions and how to resolve them.", 
          solution: "Use a retry mechanism to generate a new short URL if a collision occurs. Another method is to append random characters or increase the URL length dynamically if the collision rate increases."
